## ⚙ Requirements

- [CMake 3.26+](https://cmake.org/)
  - Add this to your `PATH` during installtion/updating
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest)
- [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
  - Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to the path of the vcpkg folder
  - Make sure your local vcpkg port is up-to-date by pulling the latest and do `vcpkg integrate install`

## ⬇️ Get started

### 💻 Register Visual Studio as a Generator

- Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`
- Run `cmake`
- Close the cmd window

### 📦 Dependencies

- [CommonLibSF](https://github.com/Starfield-Reverse-Engineering/CommonLibSF)
- [DKUtil](https://github.com/gottyduke/DKUtil)

These dependencies can be configured through the git submodule by running `update-submodule.bat`. Alternatively, the dependencies can also use a local git repository, by setting the `CommonLibSFPath` and `DKUtilPath` environment variables to the path of the local git repository.

In order to enable local git repository lookup, existing folders within `extern` should be **removed**.

> To prevent duplicating submodules in multiple local projects, it's recommended to clone the CommonLibSF and DKUtil repositories locally. Then, set the environment path accordingly, this ensures all projects share the same package.  

> Additionally, you can use a personal fork of CommonLibSF; this setup makes testing modifications with a plugin project easily.

### 🔨 Building

```
.\make-sln-msvc.bat
cmake --build build --config Release
```
A Visual Studio solution will be generated inside `build` folder.
